This is the Rails App for CornellRadio.com.

For beginners, for more information on how Rails works, including a thorough beginner's tutorial, check out [Mark Hartl's awesome book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book).

Make sure you have the [Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) and Git installed.

If you're planning on using Heroku with multiple accounts (probably the case), check out the [heroku-accounts plugin](https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-accounts).
